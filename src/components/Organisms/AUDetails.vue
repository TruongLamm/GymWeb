    <h2>The Goodlyfe Team</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Founded by Luke Hughes and Steph Roberts in 2015, Goodlyfe is now one of
      the most reputable fitness education providers in the UK. <br /><br />

      Dissatisfied with the quality of the fitness education sector, Luke and
      Steph set out to completely redefine the way that training courses
      operate, using their own experience and expertise to do so. Fast-forward
      nearly a decade, and Goodlyfe has certainly achieved that goal!
      <br /><br />

      Luke has been a qualified personal trainer for 14 years and has worked in
      fitness education for 7 years. He holds a First Class Honours Bachelor and
      Masters in Sports Science from Swansea University and the University of
      Leeds respectively. <br /><br />

      Steph has been involved in the fitness sector since she was 16 years old
      and has worked in fitness education for over a decade. She holds a First
      Class Degree in Strength and Conditioning with an academic distinction
      from Colorado University. Alongside this, she has also been involved in
      high-level professional sports as a strength and conditioning consultant
      and has experience launching and running her own gym. <br /><br />

      Aside from our founders, the Goodlyfe team is made up of only the most
      highly-qualified tutors who all have extensive experience as operating
      fitness professionals themselves. As well as teaching the courses
      themselves, they will be on hand via email, chatbox or phone 7 days a week
      to help and support you every step of the way!
